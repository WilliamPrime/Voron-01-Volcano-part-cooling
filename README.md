# Voron-01-Volcano-part-cooling
An unofficial, really bad part cooling solution for if you use a volcano length block with a voron v0.1

# changes compared to the default voron01 repo

- this page contains only the files for the modified part cooling ducts

# short summary of what this is
- modified part cooling ducts for dragon-HF with a volcano length block
- same footprint ish
- you loose ~10mm of z
- not great for anything that needs much part cooling

# full writing

# preamblings and context for this project

I have a voron 0.1 , i know , i didnt stop talking about it when i got it, but i actually need to talk about it now.

With the voron i exlusivly printed PLA , using it as a rapid prototyping machine for my projects
however as i went faster and faster with that printer i started to run into more and more issues with physically not being able phush enough plastic

so i went out and got a mellow heater block and cartridge that would turn my phaetus dragon HF into a volcano length block

however i couldnt find any pre existing fan ducts that would cater to this fairly odd combinatin of parts
so i deceided to create these abominations of part cooling ducts/ hotends


# Benefits of using these
- They are cool ig
- They use only the stock parts from the v0.1
- They are the same size in X and Y as the original 

# Disadvantages
- Not very great airflow, if you are using a volcano length block and pushing 40mm^3 of PLA or other plastics per second, then this solution probably provides nowhere near enough part cooling to print those materials with an auxilery part cooling fan
    - if you plan on using an aux part cooling fan then it still serves as a decent inbetween for printing between having everything on
- longer on Z axis so you loose a bit of build volume making build volume 120x120x112
